Wagtail Freelancer
=======================

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/michael-yin/wagtail-freelancer.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/michael-yin/wagtail-freelancer)

This project is a combination of [startbootstrap-freelancer](https://github.com/BlackrockDigital/startbootstrap-freelancer) and [Wagtail CMS](https://github.com/wagtail/wagtail), you can use Wagtail StreamField feature to quickly edit the content of the page.

I build this project to help people better understand how StreamField of Wagtail works.
